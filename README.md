# Satellite-Tracking-Program
The Satellite Tracking Program was created throughout the year for a course called Space Hardware (ENG 4350)
The purpose of this project is to read a file containing Two Line Elements of different GPS satellites. The program then analyzes the TLE for each satellite in the file and outputs human-readable information about the satellite such as its orbital elements. Once the file is read and analyzed, the program prompts the user to choose a satellite to track. Note that the ability to track a satellite depends on the location of the radio observatory the user is currently located at. This infomation is also supplied to the program in a text file. For the purpose of this project, the radio observatory used was Algoquin Radio Observatory. Following choosing the satellite, the program outputs a series of timings which indicate when the radio observatory will have a clear line of site to the satellite within the specified time range (The time range is a variable that is perviously chosen by the user).
